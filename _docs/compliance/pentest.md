title: Penetration and load test notification
---

If you, or an authorized third party, plan to perform a penetration test or load test of your system on Cloud.gov, please send the following to [Cloud.gov support]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/help/):

```text
* System under test: 
    (Examples would include:
    _webapp_.agency.gov or _webapp_.app.cloud.gov
    _site_.agency.gov or preview_url.pages.cloud.gov)
* Testing organization and contact information:
* Source IPs or IP ranges (for testers and their tools):
* Expected start date, (or "starting immediately"):
* Expected end date:
* Expected maximum load requests per minute (for load testing only):
* Acknowledgement that you are abiding by the terms at https://cloud.gov/docs/compliance/pentest/
```

The "system under test" is one of:

* Cloud.gov Platform: _your_ application at _application-name_.app.cloud.gov, or your external domain (e.g. https://agency.gov)
* Cloud.gov Pages: _your_ website at your preview URL (at `sites.pages.cloud.gov`), or your external domain (e.g. `_site_.agency.gov`)

"Maximum load" must be limited to maximum reasonably expected load, e.g.,
"What might we expect the hour before filing deadline?" or "What if
we trend on social media after we launch?"

You don't need an approval, and Cloud.gov doesn't provide approvals. Simply sending the notification is sufficient.

You can always run routine automated vulnerability scans on your own applications without special notification.

## Testing considerations

**Pentesting**: When testing Cloud.gov Platform systems, you can also conduct testing of:
* Your application instance via `cf ssh`
* Your [brokered services]( {{ site.baseurl }}/docs/services/intro/) either directly or via `cf ssh` or `ssh` proxy.

**Infrastructure changes**: We do NOT make infrastructure changes to accommodate any tests, since you're to test under realistic conditions. Load testing from a single IP instance will likely be rate-limited, and not reflect performance under realistic conditions.

## Exclusions

All Cloud.gov products are under regular testing by our team, and by third-party assessors, as part of our Continuous Monitoring plan. FedRAMPÂ® [makes the results available]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/overview/fedramp-tracker/#start-the-ato-process) to authorized users.
**Additional testing by your team is not warranted nor authorized.**

You are not permitted to attempt any scanning or reconnaissance from your instances or brokered services.

You are not permitted to test the Cloud.gov infrastructure, which comprises
the following sites and web applications:

```text
    https://pages.cloud.gov 
    https://pages-staging.cloud.gov 
    https://cloud.gov
    https://*.fr.cloud.gov
```

Your assessment must not target other Cloud.gov customers, nor perform or simulate denial of service attacks or otherwise violate the [Amazon AWS testing policy](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/).

## Notifications

If you suspect that you have uncovered a vulnerability in any of Cloud.gov's products, please reference our [security.txt](https://cloud.gov/.well-known/security.txt)
